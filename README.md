I am a full-stack developer and have worked as an "analyst" programmer for the last 20 yearsâ€”with the "analyst" part, I do real problem-solving.  I have always liked solving problems, and programming became my favorite tool that brought my solutions to life.

# Data Analysis

And programming goes hand to hand with data. After working on a huge and variety of applications, I wanted to play with the data and unearth hidden things. Of course, back then, there were no modern AI, data science, machine learning technologies, or services to speak of. I created OLAP cubes, wrote mind-boggling MDX queries, and waited patiently for our local servers to generate the result. Then, the cloud only meant the thing in the sky, and when an algorithm is mentioned, it only meant another quick sorting logic :)

I have begun my journey to formal data science around 2019 with Microsoft Professional Data Science Certificate Program. However, since I did not switch careers from programming to data engineer, I continued to improve my data science knowledge by taking other online programs, and I learned a lot :)

Here are some of the projects and files that are the outputs of my education:

### A descriptive analysis with Jupyter Notebook: [Green Energy Analysis](data_science/jupyter/green_energy/Green Energy Analysis.html)
